# Genetic-Algorithm from scratch.
#### Python program of the binary-coded Genetic Algorithm to solve the maximization and minimization problem using:
##### - Roulette-wheel reproduction scheme,<br>
##### - two point crossover, and<br>
##### - bit-wise mutation.<br><br>
The main python code is in *main.py*.<br>
Function for decoding the values of variables is in *decode.py*.<br>
Fitness calculation function is in *fitness.py*.<br>
Parent selection is done by Roulette selection *(Roulette.py)*.<br>
Crossover function to obtain children is in *crossover.py*.<br>
Mutation function to get new children is in *mutation.py*.<br>
